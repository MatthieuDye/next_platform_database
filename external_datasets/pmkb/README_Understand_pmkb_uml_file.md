How to read the uml diagram ?

The diagram shows how we can read PMKB datasets with our tables.
PMKB lists interpretions (lines) established for a certain gene, variants linked to this gene, some tissues types and tumor types. The interpretation describes how items interacts between each others, adding some citations.


whats happening for the tables


GENE
PMKB just uses the gene name.
A gene can appear in several lines (interpretations), but each interpretation considers one and only one gene. A gene has several variants.

VARIANT
Here, variants are designated by their full name, whch is in fact the name of the gene and the name of the alteration. A variant can be linked to an interpretation.

REFERENCE
In the PMKB file, our references are "citation" type, and the content is the description. A reference can be used (or not) for several interpretations.

MORPHOLOGY
This table contains the cancer type name.

TOPOGRAPHY
This table contains the name of human body parts.

INTERPRETATION
An interpretation shows a description about a certain gene, some variants linked to this gene (or all variants, depending), the tumor types and the tissues types concerned by the association, and gathers finally several citations.
